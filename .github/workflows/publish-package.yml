# This workflow checks out a new release and publishes it to PyPI using Poetry.
#
# First it builds a wheel for every combination of OS and Python version listed, save for Python 3.11 on ubuntu-latest.
# It then starts an ubuntu-latest instance that retrieves all built wheels, and builds a wheel for Python 3.11 and a source distribution.
# Finally it uploads the source and all wheels to PyPI.
